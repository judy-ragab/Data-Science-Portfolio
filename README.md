##  Introduction
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. This portfolio showcases all my work in various data science projects. My very first data science project will be in this repository which displayed my ability to tackle real world problems and data.





## Projects
### 1. Spotify Rankings: Top Songs of 2024
#### Introduction
Most Streamed Songs and its Correlation to Social Media. Our data set, Spotify's Most Streamed Songs of 2024 provides a list of the most streamed songs on Spotify along with columns about the track name, the artist, social media views on Youtube and TikTok, and more. There were multiple ideas for this project including looking at the runtimes of the songs and comparing it to the most streamed songs but we were unable to find a data set for it. In the end, for this project, the focus will be on the most streamed songs on Spotify along with its track name and compare that to social media views on the official song video on Youtube and views on TikTok posts featuring the song. After finding a correlation between both Youtube views and TikTok views to the most streamed songs, we would also see which social media app, Youtube or TikTok, made the most impact in helping the song become the most streamed on Spotify. The final result would be numerical. This could help us predict what artists should spend more effort on, their music video or promoting their music on TikTok.
#### Visualization
I chose to do a scatterplot for my data visualization because that is one that can really help data analysts find correlation.I did seperate graphs for the columns Spotify Streams, YouTube Views, and TikTok Views because when I put them together the graph was harder to understand so I decided to split them up first and then look for a correlation then comfirm that correlation with a scatterplot with both columns. I noticed that both social media views have a possitive correlation with the Potify streams but YouTube had a stronger correlation.
